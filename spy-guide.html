            <h1>Ultimate Guide to Find the Spy Game</h1>
            <div class="meta">Published: February 23, 2025</div>
            
            <p>Find the Spy is an exciting party game that tests your deception and detective skills. Today, I'll share some valuable tips and strategies to help you master this game.</p>

            <h2>Game Rules Overview</h2>
            <p>At the start of each round, every player receives a word. Most players get the same word (civilians), while the spy receives a different but related word. Players take turns describing their word, and finally vote to identify who the spy is.</p>

                    <li>Pay attention to other players' reactions and description styles</li>
                    <li>As a civilian, try to verify information with other players subtly</li>
                    <li>As a spy, use ambiguous descriptions that could fit both words</li>

                <li>Civilian word: Police Officer / Spy word: Security Guard</li>
            </ul>
