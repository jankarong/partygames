                <h3>üéØ Game Objective</h3>
                <p>Similar to hedbanz rules but with a twist - try to avoid making the actions or saying the words shown
                    on your card. If you accidentally do the
                    action, you'll be eliminated. The last player remaining wins!</p>

                <h3>üéÆ How to Play</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose 2-10 players to participate</li>
                    <li>Players take turns drawing cards</li>
                    <li>After drawing a card, that player must avoid doing the action shown on their card</li>
                    <li>If a player does their forbidden action, other players can point it out, and that player is
                        eliminated</li>
                    <li>Eliminated players can still observe and point out other players' actions</li>
                    <li>The game continues until only one player remains</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>üí° Game Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember: Act natural, don't make obvious attempts to avoid your forbidden action</li>
                    <li>Watch other players carefully for their forbidden actions</li>
                    <li>Stay alert - other players might try to trick you into doing your action</li>
                    <li>Even if eliminated, stay engaged and help spot other players' mistakes</li>
                </ul>
