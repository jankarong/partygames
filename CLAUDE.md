# Party Games Project Guidelines

## SEO Standards

When adding new games, follow these SEO character limits:

### Meta Tags Character Limits
- **Title**: 50-60 characters (max 70)
- **Description**: 150-160 characters (max 320)  
- **Keywords**: 5-10 keywords only (meta keywords are largely ignored by search engines)

### Required Elements for Each Game
- [ ] Favicon using game's logo (`<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="./[game-logo].png">`)
- [ ] Title within character limit
- [ ] Description within character limit
- [ ] Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image)
- [ ] Canonical URL
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data

## File Structure
- Each game should be in its own folder under `/games/`
- Game logo should be in the same folder as the HTML file
- Use existing CSS and JS structure for consistency

## Notes
- Focus on natural keyword integration in title and description
- Avoid keyword stuffing
- Ensure mobile-friendly descriptions (shorter is better)
